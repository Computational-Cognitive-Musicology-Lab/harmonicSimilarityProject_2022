"1965","<h1>Instructions</h1> <p>In this experiment you will listen to 40 pairs of chord progressions. Each ""chord progression"" is a sequence of four, five, or six musical chords, played at a regular pace. In each trial, you will hear a <em>first</em> chord progression played twice, followed by a short pause, followed by a <em>second</em> chord progression played twice:</p> <p><img src=""Diagram.svg"" style=""width:800px;"" /></p> <p>In some cases, the first and second chord progressions will be very similar, or even exactly the same. In other cases, they might be very different. Your goal is to judge how similar <em>you</em> think they sound, and tell us using the slider. There are no ""right answer""&mdash;we want to know <em>your</em> intuitive judgements!</p> <p>If you think the two chord progressions sound exactly the same, set the slider to the far left position. If you think they sound really dramatically different, you could set the slider towards the far right. We encourage you to <em>not</em> base your judgements entirely on counting how many chords are the same or different in the progressions&mdash;rather, think about the overall musicality of the progressions and ask yourself ""how similar would music using these two progressions feel?"".</p> <p>Once you've set the slider, click the ""Continue"" button to move on. After you click ""Continue,"" there will be a short pause, then the next pair of progressions will play.</p> <p>Please do not navigate away or refresh the page, as you will have to start over from scratch.</p>","0","html-button-response","4","59689","0.0-4.0","",""
