This research will help us better understand how musical <em>chord progressions</em> work in popular and classical music. This study is intended for people familiar with Western classical music, jazz, or modern popular music from the USA, China, Japan, or Korea. If you feel like you are not really familiar with any of these musical genres, this study is probably not right for you.</p> <p>The study should take approximately 20&ndash;30 minutes to complete. Your participation in this study is always voluntary and you may discontinue your participation at any time.</p> <h4 id="ethics">Ethics:</h4> <p>This study has been reviewed by the Georgia Tech Institutional Review Board, and has been identified as ‘Minimal risk research’ (Ethics ID #H22176). The risks of participating in this study are no greater than any casual music listening or other normal daily activities.</p> <h4 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality:</h4> <p>We will comply with any applicable laws and regulations regarding confidentiality. Your responses to the study questions will be entirely anonymous and confidential. No personal data will be gathered from you, and your identity will never be associated with your data, published, or disclosed in any way.</p> <p>To make sure that this research is being carried out in the proper way, the Georgia Institute of Technology IRB may review study records. The Office of Human Research Protections may also look at study records.
